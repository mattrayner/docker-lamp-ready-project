# docker-lamp-ready-project
A 'simple' project, set up to implement [mattrayner/lamp](https://github.com/mattrayner/docker-lamp) with a pre-created database called `c5db`.

## MySQL User
The mattrayner/lamp image comes with a root account that has no password (this accountt can only be user locally).

MySQL user `admin` has password `zuTa0tvoIXDl`. We recommend you change this at the earliest moment possible. This account can be used for connection within phpMyAdmin.
